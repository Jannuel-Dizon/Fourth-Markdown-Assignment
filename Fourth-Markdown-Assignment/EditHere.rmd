The primary concern is if there is a relationship in the household's income to its source of electricity. 

The results gathered from the study, through interview, states that there is indeed a relationship to the household's financial income to its source of electricity, as it can be seen from the figure that the wealthier households, or the higher the household's financial income, tend to have a higher percentage of using grid electricity, compared to the other two class, no matter the area. 

It also shows that the area's level of urbanization has a significant influence in the household's source of electricity regardless of the household's social class; the most probable reasons for this are the availability of the source in the area, location of the area, and the reliability of the energy. Regardless, grid electricity as energy source still favors those of households that have a higher financial standing.
